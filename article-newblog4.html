			Hello Hoomans
		</p>

		<p>
			Hope you are doing well! 

		</p>

		<h1 style="color: orange;">SPONSORSHIP</h1>

		<p>
			Today's blog is sponsored by “BAWARKAT” so shout out to them. They have an amazing range of skincare. Launched in 2018, BARAWKAT has been manufacturing 100% made halal health and beauty products Since the beginning, BARAWKAT insists on only natural skincare products formulated with only natural plants and certified organic ingredients. With 4 skincare products and 3 supplement products for health, BARAWKAT is exporting to over 10 countries and 300 distributors.So I personally was interested in their 100% sodium hyaluronate serum, and I think it was a good serum. For those of you wondering what hyaluronate is? It is a natural substance produced by our skin so hyaluronic acid is available in 2 forms- sodium and potassium. There's no major difference between the two except for their molecular weights. It can be used on all skin types along with a little moisturizer. It promotes quick wound healing, anti-aging, and hydrates it. I will be linking their website down below, so make sure you check them out.

			So coming back to today's blog I think I might have a few things that will make med-school easier for you. I am listing medical school essentials below. Some of which I found late (oops). Kindly note that medical students are different as well as medical schools.
		</p>

		<h2>
			1. A good backpack
		</h2>

		<p>
			This is a top medical school essential. You need a bag to keep your textbooks, study notes, pens, highlighters, lab coats, stethoscopes, diagnostic sets, lunch, and so on. And at the same time, it is a plus if you find a backpack that serves all these purposes and at the same time is cozy and comfortable to carry around. Here is a backpack I am currently using and find super comfy.

		</p>

		<h2>
			2. A GOOD LAPTOP/TABLET
		</h2>

		<p>
			Reading and watching those Anatomy, Pathology, and Obstetrics study materials and videos are obviously better on a widescreen.

A widescreen increases clarity and improves retention. So if you can afford a laptop or a good tablet, go for it. You will not regret doing so in your medical school journey. I would recommend ios only if you have been previously using it. There are a lot of other options for a better price. So do your research.

 
		</p>

		<h2>
			3. POWERBANK 
		</h2>

		<p>
			You will have to carry your mobile phones and tablets around the wards and clinics during your clinical rotations. And you may not have the time to find a charging port for your phone or tablet even when their batteries are drained.

		</p>

		<h2>
			4. A GOOD STETHOSCOPE
		</h2>

		<p>
			
			The most popular stethoscope used by medical students is the Littmann stethoscope. As a medical student, you do not need any of those high-tech cardiology stethoscopes. Just a simple one to help you carry out your physical examinations. I also know that some medical school provides stethoscopes
		</p>

		<h2>
			5.HIGHLIGHTERS AND PENS
		</h2>

		<p>
			You will eventually develop your own system for highlighting or underlining, but I think almost all of my friends utilize different colors of highlighters for different things. I personally underline or highlight different things with different colors (all drugs are green, all enzymes and mechanisms purple, diseases in blue, etc), but I also have a friend who highlights with a different color each time she goes over content to keep track of things that continually stand out. Buy those colored pens and highlighters in bulk!
		</p>

		<p>
			Hope you found this useful.
