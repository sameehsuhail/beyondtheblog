			Hello Hoomans
		</p>

		<p>
			Hope you are doing well! 

		</p>

		<p>
			The pandemic seems to have no end even though I have faith in our frontline workers and biotechnologists, and someday corona shall be a tale. Quick update on what has been happening in my life. Lately, I have been preparing for my exams and I had also caught covid. I have recovered from covid but those 14 days of quarantine did play with my mind.	
		</p>

		<p>
			Over a year ago things were different, gatherings and traffic were normal. Travelling was fun and not scary, and then one-day things flipped over. It was quite normal initially until I learned more about the virus and its infection pathway, which to be honest is scary. The images of lungs and the fact that a proper funeral can't be held is scary. <b>It doesn’t really affect you until the suffering is personel. </b>
		</p>

		<p>
			I am not really social and so never went out much even before the pandemic but the pandemic cuts you off from yourself too. Some of us who learn how to invest this time in ourselves benefited out of the pandemic but the rest of us fell into the dark space no one wants to be in. Thanks to <a href="https://www.headspace.com/meditation/tips">headspace tips</a>, I did learn about meditation and it has helped me a lot. There are a few things I learned during the pandemic, specifically when I caught covid and was isolated from my family.
		</p>
<br>
		<p>
			The isolation part made me really anxious, I constantly felt lazy and dull. I had exams the same week and all of it had built up unrequired stress, but it’s okay sometimes to feel things- bad or negative, what is important is that you learn.
		</p>
<br>
		<h3>
			You may feel sad.
		</h3><br>

		<p>
			Sad that traditions such as prom or graduation are now cancelled. Sad that you cannot see your friends in person every day, that you cannot hang out at your favorite coffee shop. Sad that you cannot go to the gym, or to team meetings that you looked forward to. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			You may feel angry.
		</h3><br>

		<p>
			Angry that the end of the school year was ripped from you without asking permission. Angry that events you eagerly anticipated for years cannot happen anymore. Angry that you lost your job that you were just getting the hang of. You can understand and support that it is necessary to quarantine, and you can still be mad about it. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			You may feel anxious.
		</h3><br>

		<p>
			Anxious that you didn’t have time to plan for much of society shutting down. Anxious that these changes are out of your control, but you must respond to them. Anxious that your routine is disrupted, and that what you usually do for self-care is no longer possible.
		</p>

		<h3>
			You may feel happy.
		</h3><br>

		<p>
			Happy that external factors have allowed you to temporarily hit the “pause” button on some things that were causing you stress. Happy that you get to spend more time with family or friends with whom you are quarantined. Happy to catch up on relaxing, to start back on that hobby you started last break. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			You may feel guilty.
		</h3><br>

		<p>
			Guilty that you have Wi-Fi and can participate in online classes without much of a burden, but you still feel off. Guilty that you are relaxed during a world crisis. Guilty that people are dying, but you are sad that social events are canceled. 
		</p> <br>

		<b>Whatever you are feeling is okay. But there is no reason to feel guilty.</b>
		<br>

		<p>You may feel a hundred emotions rushing into your body at the same time.</p>

		<br>

		<p>Please remember that everyone's quarantine experience is different so don’t compare yours.</p>

		<br>

		<p>Out of the people who are undergoing mental health issues 39% are students and 61% are between the age of 18 and above who don’t seek treatment. What is so shameful about our society is that they help us be amazing doctors, web developers, and degree holders but they also are the ones that discourage us and build unnecessary tension. The fact that teachers slut-shame you for wearing a short skirt to school and never talk about sensitizing men on rape just shows where we live is a bad place. I do wanna go into the depths of this topic but maybe some other blog.</p>

<p>If a close one or anyone you know is going through a crisis mentally or emotionally please provide support. You could check the pages I have liked below to learn more about how to talk to people who are going through a hard time.</p>
