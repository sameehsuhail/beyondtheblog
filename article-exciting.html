			I know I don’t blog quite regularly but I hope you understand that I am only new to this and that it shall take some time for me to get used to it. This time i have some exciting news. ISOTOPE.
		</p>

		<h4><u>
			WHAT IS THE ISOTOPE?
		</u></h4>



		<p>
			It is my upcoming book, which shall soon be published. It is currently under the editorial process and hopefully will be out in May. This is my first ever book so, YES IT IS EXCITING NEWS. 
		</p>

		<h4><u>
		HOW DID I START WRITING?
		</u></h4>
		
		<p>
			Well it is very hard to track down how and when I exactly started writing, but what I know is that writing in my- ‘escape from the world space’. I believe we all have or atleast need to have that space where we can find ourselves expressing or doing what we love. Now, why is that important? The answer is simple because it enriches our lives, maybe it isn’t so obvious that it is helping you, it takes time to feel peace.<br><br>
			Maybe you should try writing. I know writing isn’t for everyone, but it doesn’t have to be perfect words put together, it could be simple words from your heart- about your day, about your emotions, past. ANYTHING.
		</p>

		<p>
		<u>Writing Helps Your Clear Your Mind</u>
		</p>

		<p>
			We've all sometimes felt the need to vent and speak our minds in order to get our point across.
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, writing can help you do that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Try and write down all of your thoughts, grievances, doubts, fantasies, and pretty much everything else that crosses your mind. Just write, without thinking about what lands on paper or your computer screen. It may seem like the end result is something pretty chaotic, but that’s not the point.
		</p>

		<p>
			The point is for you to clear your mind, so that you can go about your day, working, solving problems, and just enjoying life. Without all those thoughts in the back of your head distracting you, you will find it easier to work and focus, no matter what your profession is.
		</p>


		<p><u>
		GIVES YOU A VIEW OF WHERE YOU STAND
		</u></p>

		<p>
			One of the most basic examples of this is keeping a journal, but it’s not the only way of putting things into perspective.
		</p>

		<p>
			Writing fiction will also help you analyze things and look at them from a different point of view. You will be able to draw parallels between those fictional events and situations, and those which took place for real in your life. This will help you look at them in a more objective light.
		</p>

		<p>
			I don’t know what exactly someone could possibly go through, and trust me no one would- not your therapist, friends or family. It’s you who can understand yourself better than anyone else and no that doesn’t mean you stop seeing your therapist, sometimes we need to know where we lie from a different perspective.
		</p>

		<p>
			As I always say to emphasize mental health it is very IMPORTANT. 
		</p>

		<p><u>
			WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
		</u></p>

		<p>
			1. PAIN comes from a very personal space. Any emotion demands to be felt and not avoided. In order to feel better you have to deal with it. Running away will never help.
		</p>

		<p>
			2. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is important we educate our surroundings and ourselves on this topic. Why?
		</p>

		<p><b>
			1. It affects more people than you know.
		</b></p>

		<p>
			Almost everyone is affected by mental illness. Whether they are personally dealing with it or they have a loved one who is, mental health is important to everyone. You can find the statistics here at <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml">nimh</a>
		</p>

		<p><b>
			2. It helps people seek treatment.
		</b></p>

		<p>
			Talking about mental health increases awareness, education and support, while decreasing stigma. This can also help open the door for people seeking treatment or help with their mental health.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here I’ve linked a few sites you can find help from
		</p>

		<p>
			UNITED KINGDOM - <b><a href="https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/">Samaritans</a></b> free at any time, on 116 123<br>
		<i>For people experiencing suicidal thoughts.</i>
		</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			
		GLOBAL- <a href="https://checkpointorg.com/global/"> https://checkpointorg.com/global/ </a>
		</p>

		<p><b>
			3. It reduces stigma.
		</b></p>
		
		<p>
			People who suffer from mental illness can often feel alone and stereotyped. The stigma that mental illness is something to be kept secret can further hinder the mental health of those suffering, even to the point where they may feel uncomfortable and embarrassed seeking any treatment at all.
		</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Coming back to the topic of Isotope. What is it about? You can find more details on my social media page, but a general overview of it would be-
		</p>

		<p>
			Isotope is a science fiction novel about a girl Ava Williams who is trapped in an alternate dimension. She struggles to get out of this place only to reveal what she really wants. This series book is a good read for readers who like sci-fi.
