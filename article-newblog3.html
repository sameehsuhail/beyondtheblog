			Hello Hoomans
		</p>

		<p>
			Hope you are doing well! 

		</p>

		<p>
			It's been a while since my last blog, I had a lot happening. first off, ISOTOPE IS OUT, and it has been overwhelming. So for today, I have an interview post. This one was done by Kasmir times. You can always find more about me on my social media. 

		</p>

		<p>
			1. Tell us something about yourself?

		</p>

		<p>
			Hello, my name is Ghufran Hussain. I am a 20-year-old published author of the book “ISOTOPE”. Besides being a writer I am a full-time medical student at Iran University Of Medical Sciences.

		</p>

		<p>
			2. When did you first realize you wanted to be a writer?
		</p>

		<p>
			I must have been in grade 1 when I wrote my first ever poem on a fictional character which was published in our in-school yearly magazine. At age 10 I wrote another poem which again got published, this time my friends and classmates appreciated my work. For a 10-year-old it was a big deal, and that was the time I started writing occasionally. I had my first major breakthrough in grade 10 when I had taken interest in poetry and one of my teachers noticed and had called me in to guide me better in literature. It was that year when I became the editor of my school magazine. I wrote poems on mental health and even started a page on Instagram. Eventually, I realized I really enjoyed what I did so writing became a part of me. 


		</p>

		<p>
			3. What do you do apart from writing? 


		</p>

		<p>
			Besides being a writer, I am a medical student at the Iran University Of Medical Sciences, Tehran. I also practice different forms of art such as painting, dancing, crocheting, etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			4. What was your first book about and when did you pen it down? 
		</p>

		<p>
			So my first book was a crime-thriller novel which for some reason I didn’t publish. I must have been 15-years-old when it was written. As writers, insecurities are common I believe, especially if our works are really personal. Some of my poetry was really close to me, hence I hesitated to post them or publish them anywhere. My mother has constantly asked me to continue writing even on days when I felt like giving up. This pandemic has actually made me a lot more insecure about my work, knowing that there are people who can relate to my work was a major factor in publishing my work.


		</p>





		<p>
			5. How long does it take you to write this book?
		</p>

		<p>
			
So this book took me 3 months to complete. I had just completed schooling and my entrance exam when the pandemic had become something everyone feared. I had more than enough time to do day-to-day activities and I didn’t feel like wasting it, so I began the journey of penning down “ISOTOPE”. I wrote short stories and poems, on anything and everything. The pandemic had started right when my schooling was over, and I barely met anyone. It was starting to become a hard time for me, to adapt to the whole lockdown situation and I thought this was the right time for me to publish my work and keep myself engaged. So I began writing Isotope.
		</p>

		<p>
			6. How did you get it published?
		</p>

		<p>
			Writing is not the major part, it is publishing, editing, proofreading, formatting and all the processes a book has to go through is the hard part. After I completed the writing process, I began to look for cover page designers, editors, and proofreaders and I was lucky enough to find an already published poetess Fatima Saleem who herself is very young as the editor of my book and cover page designer- Teesha Suvarna. And then I came across an international publisher 2nimble who published my work. 
		</p>

		<p>
			7. Was it easy going or a difficult task? 
		</p>

		<p>Nothing in this world comes easy to anyone, so definitely it was a hassle and cumbersome process. I remember struggling to write certain scenes and it would make me feel unworthy. Even after the writing part was completed I would re-read my work to make sure that everything was perfect. Thankfully I had the strongest woman- my mother on my side who supported me throughout.</p>

		<p>8. Tell us something about your book. </p>
		<u>A brief synopsis of the book:</u><br>
		<p>Isotope is a sci-fi novel based on a 20-year-old girl, Ava Williams who was an electrical engineer at Acromatt United. An accident at work resulted in her being sent to an alternate dimension where she tries to find her way back to earth. She meets a few friends from the earth along the way and together they discover a way to go back home when Ava realizes that the mannerisms of people towards her had changed and the society was hostile. This results in her going back to the isotope and finding ways to survive in that alternate reality.</p>


<u>A short synopsis about the book: </u> <br>
		<p>Isotope is a series of novels, this being the first in the series. Ava Williams, an inhabitant of Earth, enters a whole different dimension of the world called Isotope. As she learns to survive every day yearning to return back home someday, but when she does everything changes. She realizes that Earth has changed drastically. </p>


		<p>9. What genre do you like to read and who's your favorite writer? </p>

<p>To be honest, I’ve wild imaginations that can literally create multiple worlds in my head. Just the fact that I can put out my wild thoughts in the form of a story makes it crazy. The fact that I’m able to make my readers experience the thought process in my head is simply amazing. 

	American Gods, The Time Traveller's Wife, and Maze Runner are some of my favorite sci-fi books. I'm not a fan of the authors of this genre but yes Khaled Hosseini is the author I love. I adore his books, I think his works have impacted a huge population.
	
	In general, I love fiction. Crime-thrillers, science-fiction, and horror fiction are my favorite.
	
	</p>

	<p>10. How has been the feedback? </p>
	<p>I have received love and blessing from a lot of people, the book alhamdulillah has been doing pretty good too. Isotope is available on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and some bookstores in GCC. It is also available for my ebook readers.</p>
	<p>11. As a child, what did you want to do when you grew up?</p>
	<p>As a child, I always wanted to be a doctor, and I have never diverted from my path to being a doctor. Growing up I was introduced to many other things that I as well enjoyed, and always thought I would be everything I want and I would have people laugh at me telling me a master of all would mean a master of none. But my mother has been my backbone, she was the one who introduced me to literature and told me that I could always be anything and everything if I worked hard for it. So today I am a medical student, a writer, a psychology student, and a speaker for mental health.</p>	


<p>Loads of love,</p>
<p>Ghufran Hussain</p>
