			We women bleed every month it is very natural for us to feel awkward about it since no one has spoken about it openly in years it is just a recent revolution on the feminists that come together to put out a voice. As on the 28th of May everyone celebrated the world menstrual hygiene day I think it is very important specifically for the doctors and the medical students or anyone in the health care industry to put forward what exactly it is to be a woman who bleeds every month or once a year or not at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			First of all women who used pads instead of tampons it's ready necessary to understand what your pads are made of an if it is good for you and also good for the environment. Most of the pads we know are non-decomposable are not good for the environment it's very important to track the kind of pads you use or have been using. Once you've done that and every turns out that you haven't been using a path that is good for you or the environment it's better you switch. Besides are using bamboo fibers banana fibers for making pads there are even parts that are made out of pure cotton materials an also recently a menstrual cup has been introduced which is really eco-friendly so these are some alternatives you should look into.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here are a list of few women run sanitary pad companies dot use environment friendly materials.

		<h4>
			MENSTURATION
		</h4>

		<p>
			Those of you who haven't been completely educated about mensuration openly heres a bit of free sex education class for y'all so menstruation or period is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a woman's monthly cycle, this is a very important process fall fertilizing to take place. So, every month the uterus of a woman prepares for pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur the uterus or the womb sheds its lining along with a few blood vessels now the menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from the inside of the uterus and it passes out to the vagina.
		</p>

		<p>
			Periods usually start between ages 11 to 14 or it varies in women sometimes and can continue until menopause status are at about 50 to 51 years of age. Mensuration is a really vast topic to be taught in a particular blog but to give you an overview there are abnormal bleeding as well and women who do not bleed as well.
		</p>

		<h4>
			Taboos
		</h4>

		<p>
			Common taboos include that women are impure dirty sinful while demonstrating. Some women are discouraged from touching washing their genitals during the periods to eliminate the possibility that they might contaminate the water of a communal bathing area. In reality blood is the same as any other body fluid and beating regularly prevents bacterial infections.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another very concerning and harmful practice that is existing is that menstruation is female genital mutilation or FGM. FGM comes in many forms but is generally the cutting or the labia or clitoris and sometimes the closing of the vaginal opening with a thread or with part of the cut labia. Now as a human with some amount of knowledge it is very common to understand that these practices can cause a lot of health issues in women and girls and is thankfully recognized by the human rights violation. Besides being recognized it is still practiced in many countries or at least parts of countries menstruation taboos child marriage, adolescent pregnancy, and FGM are realities that have been practiced will continued to be practiced in many parts of the world.

			I had recently come across this article in which it had mentioned about women burying their clothes into the grounds as menstruating was considered pollution or evil and couldn't worship or devote themselves to God.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is normal to talk about periods and I don't know when but I hope someday it has become normal.
		</p>

		<p>
			For those of you wondering
		</p>

		<h5><u>
			Why are we supposed to talk about menstruation?
		</h5></u>

		<p>
			I was 12 years old when I was first educated about mensuration in my school and it was an all girls class the boys were asked to excuse the class and the first question I had out of curiosity is that why weren't boys allowed to know about it didn't they go through the same process as we do and when I came to know that it was only a woman thing. I still don't understand why were they asked to leave and then one of the teachers there was quite kind enough to tell me that some of us might feel embarrassed about talking on this topic in front of the boys so the boys are asked to leave for that particular reason. I am not only blaming boys but even girls here for not normalizing talking about menstruation. I remember one of the girls behind me saying “oh right the boys won't learn about it until the next year, they aren't mature enough” she laughs Men are indeed spared from the monthly hell of periods but still they cannot escape the bitter reality where most men will live with a menstruating women at some point in their life and that is why it is important that men should be equally educated about menstruation they should have the knowledge about the phenomenon that would probably facilitate in their everyday lives at some point. Yet we try to silence the discussion about this bodily normality. I don't blame men for suppressing the conversation, it is often women who teach our kids to never speak loudly about periods. I've never heard a girl ask for a tampon in a conversational voice it is always whispering, mumbling, signaling, everything but a conversation. Why does asking for a tampon differ from asking for a tissue or even water. In many countries women aren't allowed to enter attend religious functions as I had mentioned in one of the taboos above or attend schools even because they do not have all the facilities that a menstruating woman would require and hence their mothers believe it's better for them to take the day off and stay at home and rest. Now having a day off is a whole different thing and I believe it is necessary because as there is something called as maternity leave why can't there be something called a period leave Today's blog is entirely concentrated on why can't we talk about menstruation openly
		</p>

		<h5><u>
			How can we talk about Menstruation?
		</u></h5>

		<p>
			Gather knowledge learn everything about mensuration everything that is supposed to know and the more it is the better it is. Try initiating conversation with your significant other your mothers or sisters and try asking them if it is OK to have this conversation and if not, how can you make them feel more comfort. There are many articles on how you can communicate to women or emphasize about menstruation. If you're a woman and don't feel comfortable talking about menstruation openly it's your body and you have to accept the way you are and just give it some time I believe try learning more about it and understanding why you are not comfortable talking about it.
