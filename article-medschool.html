			First off congratulations you’ve made it to medical school, for those of you who are going to be a future medical student you’re at the right place. First thing after making it into med-school people spammed me with questions like-
		</p>

		<p>
			“how much did you pay?”
		</p>

		<p>
			” Did you take up medicine under peer or parental pressure.”	
		</p>

		<p>
			“By the time you become a doctor, you should have a settled life.”
		</p>

		<p>
			“medical is hard, right?”
		</p>

		<p>
			The hardest part of medical school has nothing to do with medical school. It has everything to do with not having a personal life or personal time. It has everything to do with putting your life on hold and continuing to delay gratification while you watch the other people in your life move forward. You’ve hit pause for an indeterminate amount of time, and everyone around you is moving forward. It is nothing like they are having an easy time either, college life slams reality on our faces, high school life was 10 times easier than college life. I don’t think anything could have prepared me for that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It is going to be hard to maintain social and educational life, and to balance that is what I’ll be talking about in my future blogs.
		</p>

		<p>
			A few of my fellow mates were parents had relationships, got married, and even balanced a great social life. I tried and failed in these respects, but at the end of the day, I had to survive — just survive. I often didn’t know what day it was, the current events on the news, any songs on the radio, any references to pop culture, or recent movies or music. I just try to make it out alive.
		</p>

		<h4><u>
			Is it worth going to med school?
		</u></h4>

		<p>
			Firstly, ask yourself why you are doing this. If you really want this, and if the answer was yes then it is worth it.
		</p>

		<h6><u>Cons</u></h6>
			
			<p>
			1.     Somethings you might want to know ahead would be, becoming a doctor requires TIME- a lot of time.
			</p>

			<p>
				Becoming a practicing doctor means you will spend much of your life studying. If you do not enjoy school and learning, this might be more of a negative or con for you. At a minimum, it will take you four years of medical school and three to seven years of residency training. It takes around 14 years to become a doctor.
				</p>

				<p>
					2.     Whatever your reasons for wanting to become a doctor are, you’ve probably asked this one question– is the cost of medical school worth it?
				</p>

				<p>
					You will also have to budget for books, supplies, test fees, lab fees, and living costs, etc. Unless you have a considerable amount saved up to meet these costs, you will likely turn to student loans.
				</p>

				<p>
					3.     Burnouts! Med school life is physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing. As you strive to save more lives, you will be forced to multitask, endure long shifts.
				</p>

				<p>
					Back to our important question – is medical school worth it? Well, after weighing the pros of becoming a doctor against the cons, most aspiring physicians think that it’s worth it. Ultimately, you will have to decide for yourself.
				</p>

				<u>
					Hopefully, it helped you.
				</u><br>

				<u>
					Good luck to you all! 
				</u>
