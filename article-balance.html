			The current pandemic has affected a lot of us, socially, mentally, and emotionally. The mind is the center where you let positivity or negativity live. I believe mental health awareness is important for all. A lot of our geographically separated communities still don’t believe in mental health.
		</p>

		<p>
			Students, doctors, engineers, mothers, and humans need to help emphasize this in their lives.  It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Please enjoy this poem on mental health:
		</p>

		<p>
			With her head hung low<br>

			And nowhere to go,<br>

			She can’t explain,<br>

			A weird feeling.
		</p>

		<p>
			It comes fast,<br>

			How long shall this last?<br>

			Her head starts to spin,<br>

			She doesn’t let this voice in.
		</p>

		<p>
			She asks this feeling to go away,<br>

			She can’t deal with this one more day.
		</p>

		<p>
			The voices in her head

			Drag like a blade against your wrist.<br>

			If I cut will you let me sleep, she asks.<br>

			They all agreed.<br>

			She would do anything if they let her be.
		</p>

		<p>
			She screams and screams and screams,<br>

			It is not real she says to herself.<br>

			Hoping she would be able to breathe happily again.
								</p>

								<h4><u>How to be alone and not lonely</u></h4>

								<p>You don’t need others around you to be happy. That’s simply not true. You’re good enough all by yourself. Take up a new hobby. Set and accomplish goals. Do what you want to do, not what others make you think you should be doing. Doesn’t matter if you are not good with your hobbies, as long as they make you happy.</p>

								<h4><u>How to reduce isolation and improve socialization</u></h4>

								<p>Find your balance between your physical world and mental world, it is important. Just think of it as two people trying to communicate, but neither speak a language that they understand.</p>

								<h4><u>Few self-care activities you can do in the morning</u></h4><br>

								<h5>1.   Avoid your phone!</h5>

								<p>By avoid your phone I really mean to stay away from it. Allow yourself a morning without the mindless scrolling through Facebook or Instagram.</p>
								
								<h5>2.   Meditate</h5>
								
									<p>If you're not sure where to start, try a few breathing exercises from <a href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/uz2255">uofmhealth</a> </p>

									<h5>3.   Move your body.</h5>

									<p>Besides meditation, walking around your room or just get your body to do some work. This will help you.</p>

									<h5>4.   Set a to-do list.</h5>

									<p>It literally will take you a minute. You can have a productive day, just INVEST IN YOURSELF. This might be a small thing but it will make a difference.</p>

									<h4><u>Why is self-care such a big deal?</u></h4><br>
									
									<p>IT BUILDS YOUR CHARACTER. What you do, what you speak, everything in your life decides who you are. Above all it lets your body build a healthy relationship with the mind.</p>
									
									<h4><u>COMMUNICATE</u></h4>

									<p>I know this isn’t easy, communicating. Talking about something so personal to you isn’t going to be easy-but taking a small step towards it makes a big difference. You don’t necessarily need a therapist, talk it out to your friends, family or whosoever you feel comfortable.</p>
									<p>Always remember that talking too much sanity could get you crazy too.</p>

									<p>I hope this helped you.<br>

										If you need any help or would like further assistance, reach out to me! I would be happy to help!</p><br><br>
