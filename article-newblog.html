			Hello Hoomans!
		</p>

		<p>
			I know I don't regularly post blogs, but as I say I'm new to this and still learning. First things first, my final exams are up next month, so I am trying my best to maintain my social life with my current schedule. I have breakouts almost every day and I know it is very hard to deal with things in medical school but I guess in the end you realize that you've made through, even though you see a lot of hurdles ahead. Being a medical student actually never ends even when you graduate from medical school. Your journey actually begins Every year because we get to learn so many things. So besides that, I really want to bring up something that has been affecting me in the past few weeks. I have been quite upset about what has been happening in the world. Not Corona specifically I believe Corona is the bigger image affecting all of us and even though it has been a year it is hard to normalize it. The smaller issue which dominates my mind is the war, be it Palestine being attacked or Hindu- Muslim in India. Let's break it down into parts.

		</p>

		<p>
			Right now India is going through its most difficult moment in the pandemic thus far. Daily COVID-19 cases continue to set record highs, with hospitals filled to capacity and in need of urgent supplies to cope with the increasing number of patients. I know other countries are facing crisis too, but I am particularly disturbed by this one because the news has spammed my head and I can't help but think about how people die there. As the coronavirus pandemic rapidly sweeps across the world, it is inducing a considerable degree of fear, worry, and concern in the population at large and among certain groups in particular, such as older adults, care providers, and people with underlying health conditions.	
		</p>

		<p>
			In public mental health terms, the main psychological impact to date is elevated rates of stress or anxiety. But as new measures and impacts are introduced – especially quarantine and its effects on many people’s usual activities, routines, or livelihoods – levels of loneliness, depression, harmful alcohol, and drug use, and self-harm or suicidal behavior are also expected to rise
		</p>

		<p>
			In populations already heavily affected, such as Lombardy in Italy, issues of service access and continuity for people with developing or existing mental health conditions are also now a major concern, along with the mental health and well-being of frontline workers.
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, the war in Palestine. I don't know how I have slept at night in the past week, I could barely get excited about Eid or anything around me. The feeling when something completely dominates your mind. Watching videos of young children crying and praying. Something that really affected me was a video I had seen online. This specific video had kids playing on a trampoline whilst in the background blasts took place/ My heart broke to see how the kids didn't even react since they are used to it. I don't know when they shall have what they deserve. My only question is how can countries fund Israel? Where are the human rights advocates now
		</p>

		<p>
			It is going to be hard to maintain social and educational life, and to balance that is what I’ll be talking about in my future blogs.
		</p>

		<p>
			I try to avoid negativity here as much as I can, but sometimes I can't help but think about how can people do things they say they couldn't.
		</p>

		<p>
			Besides all this, I have been working on publishing Isotope as soon as I can. I am really excited about this book. You can also check out my interview with a gulf magazine here

			It was an amazing experience putting out my story in public.

			I'm keeping this blog short as I have something else coming come. Stay tuned.
