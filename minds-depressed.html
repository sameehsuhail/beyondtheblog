	<h5>1. Talk to someone</h5>
	<p>
		The simple act of talking to someone who cares about you is crucial to dealing with feelings of depression.
		Talk to a close friend or family member about what you’re going through. Reaching out is not a sign of weakness and won’t make you a burden.
		The person you talk to doesn’t have to be able to fix you; they just need to listen without being distracted or judging you.
		It can be tempting to retreat into your shell when you feel depressed, but try to stay as social as you can—even when you don’t feel like it.
		
		</p>


		<h5>2. Get moving</h5>
<p>

	It’s probably the last thing you feel like doing right now—but getting active, even for a short period.
	Take a short, 15-minute walk to boost your mood for several hours.
	Dance to your favorite music.
	Play with your dog or kids.
	Try online exercise classes for aerobics, interval training, or Pilates.
	Create a simple home gym using resistance bands, water bottles, or your own body weight.
	Stretch or practice simple yoga poses.
</p>

<h5>3. Make a new hobby</h5>

<p>
	Find your ideas <a href= "https://www.mydomaine.com/hobby-ideas">here</a>
</p>

<h5>4. Add mindfulness to your day</h5>
<p>
	Mindfulness is the practice of focusing your attention on the present moment and accepting it without judgment. It can prevent you from getting caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past.
	Listen to a favorite song.
	
	Try a mindful chore.
	
	Meditate. <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/meditations/mindful-breathing-meditation.htm">HelpGuide</a> can help you harness the power of your breath.
</p>

<h5>5. Express gratitude </h5>
<p>
	When you’re depressed, everything in life can seem bleak and hopeless
	Take a deep breath and think of one thing you’re grateful for: your children, your home, or a pet, for example.
	Before you switch off the light at night, take a moment to write down something that made you grateful today. Focus your mind on it as you fall asleep.
	Try HelpGuide’s <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/meditations/gratitude-in-difficult-times-meditation.htm"> Gratitude in Difficult Times</a> meditation to find gratitude even during the struggles of this pandemic.
</p>

<h5>6. Get your daily dose of sunlight </h5>
<p>
	Take a walk at lunchtime, drink your morning coffee outside, or spend time outdoors exercising or doing yard work.
Increase the amount of natural light in your home by opening blinds and drapes and sitting near windows.
Paint your walls in lighter colors or use daylight simulation bulbs.
If you live somewhere with little winter sunshine, try using a light therapy box.
</p>

<h5>7. Don't ignore suicidal thoughts</h5>
<p>
	Depression is a major risk factor for suicide. If the deep despair and hopelessness that accompanies depression makes suicide feel like the only way to escape the pain, please reach out for help.
find a helpline in your country at <a href="https://www.befrienders.org/suicidal-feelings">helpline</a>
</p>

<h5>8. Find a simple source of joy </h5>
<p>
	Listen to uplifting music, watch funny videos online, or download episodes of your favorite sitcom.
Try to spend some time in nature—go for a walk in the park or find a new hiking trail.
Help a friend or neighbor with an errand. Helping others can be just as beneficial to you as it is for them.
Take a class online, listen to a lecture, or take a virtual tour of a museum.
Take up a new hobby, learn to play an instrument, or write your memoirs—anything that brings you a sense of joy.

</p>

<h5>9. Reframe your negative thoughts </h5>
<p>
	Note when you have a negative thought such as “I’ll never be able to pay the mortgage and I’ll lose my home,” or “Everyone thinks I’m a loser.”
Challenge the thought by asking yourself “Do I know that for sure?” or “What would I say to a close friend who had the same thought?”
Change the thought to a more helpful way of thinking. “I can renegotiate mortgage payments with the bank” or “I’ve made it through bad times before. I can do it again.”
